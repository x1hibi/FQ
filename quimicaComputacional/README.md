# Computational Chemistry 

##  Class #1 Presentation 21/09/2020

### Evaluation

80% Project
20% Homework

### Forma de trabajo

1) Talk about topic
2) We made practice about the topic 
3) Write the report with the results and send the report

### *HOMEWORKS AND WORKS TO DO*:
- Install gaussian y gauss view before wednesday
- Start to think in the topic of the proyect
- Create a layout in latex for reports 
- Update notes to git and books
- Read the temary 
- Read summary about chemical teorical and quantum chemistry
- Change photo in google

### CLASS NOTES 

**Shortcuts**
- Drag : make rotation
- Ctrl+Drag : rotate with a plane fix 
- Shift+Drag : move over the current plane 
- Mouse Scroll : make zoom in and zoom out 

**Tools**
- _element fragment_: Display the periodic table and you can select a atom, functional group or termination. 
- _ring fragment_: Display a common group of rings to chose.
- _bond angle_: Here we can define the distance between two atoms, to see the options we click the button and select two connected atoms 
- _dihedral angle_: With this we can control the angle between 4 atoms over the different planes, click and select 4 atoms bounded, eg. using to make a better geometry in phenol because by default the H set is not over the same plane and we can optimize the geometry

**Actions**
-calculate
