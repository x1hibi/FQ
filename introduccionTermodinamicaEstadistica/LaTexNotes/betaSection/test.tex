\np{\bt{Random variable:} Is a variable whose value depends of a aleatory event,
    \n (Eg. throw a dice or a coin.)} 

\np{Exist two class of random variables \bt{discrete} and \bt{continuous} :}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \bt{Discrete2:} Are an array of finite values.
    \item \bt{Continuous:} Are an array of infinite values.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Discrete variables}

\np{Throw a dice is an example of aleatory event, and the array of discrete values is [1,2,3,4,5,6], if we want to know which are the probability to get the value 5 when throw the dice once, by our logic know that the probability is $\frac{1}{6}$, and this is true, but the reason behind of this is }
